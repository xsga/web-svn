 * REPOSITORY SETUP
 * ----------------
 * 
 * There are 2 methods for defining the repositiories available on the system.
 * Either you list them by hand, in which case you can give each one the name of
 * your choice, or you use the parent path function, in which case the name of
 * the directory is used as the repository name.
 *
 * In all cases, you may optionally supply a group name to the repositories.
 * This is useful in the case that you need to separate your projects. Grouped
 * repositories are referred to using the convention GroupName.RepositoryName
 *
 * You may also optionally specify the URL that clients should use to check out
 * a working copy. If used, it must be specified after the group, username, and
 * password; if these arguments are not needed, then pass null instead. Consult
 * the WebSvnConfig class in include/configclass.php for function details.
 *
 * Performance is much better on local repositories (e.g. accessed by file:///).
 * However, you can also provide an interface onto a remote repository. In this
 * case you should supply the username and password needed to access it.
 *
 * To configure the repositories by hand, copy the appropriate line below,
 * uncomment it and replace the name and URL of your repository.
